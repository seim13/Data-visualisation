# Data-visualisation
Plot interactive graph with Dash plotly on PRAMS data.
PRAMS is an American agency which collects data on pregnant women to improve their health and the baby health.
You can run my python code to see how I clean the data or you can launch my dash board to see my visualisation.
the csv files are heavy so you have to unzip them and put it in the dash folder if you want to run my it correctly.

an overview of my work can be found in the screen shot folder.
